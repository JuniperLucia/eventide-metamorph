Eventide Network's Metamorph Server, which is based on the Fabric mod, Origins.

## FAQ

* __Q__: What is this?
__A__: Thanks for checking this out! This is the repositiory for a server that is connected in a network of Minecraft servers. 'Eventide' is the name of the network, while 'Metamorph' is the name of the server. This is all still in the __Planning & Setup__ Phase, so being able to play this content is not possible _yet_.

* __Q__: What is the "Eventide Network"?
__A__: The "Eventide Network" is a Minecraft-based server that supports multiple servers that have various features and custom content.

* __Q__: What is 'Metamorph'?
__A__: Metamorph is a server that hosts a set of datapacks and a small modpack. The most relevant mods added are the 'Origins' mod, which allows for the main content to be accessed and grants the datapack's functionality. If you're familiar with the mod, you'll know it grants many abilities and quirks depending on what 'Origin' you select to play. Well, this will be that but with a twist. Origins will be unlocked by accomplishing various tasks that are related to the Origin in some shape or form. The scale of this pack is rather large, so it may be a long time before we consider it "finished".

* __Q__: Can I test/play/contribute to this pack?
__A__: Due to the current completion state of the pack, we aren't looking for any testers or developers at this time. As for playing the pack, when we reach completion milestones, alpha packs will be released with all finished content.

* __Q__: Who are the people working on this?
__A__: We're some casual Minecraft players who try to program on the side. This isn't a huge priority to us, so it might take a while to finish. Once it is brought to the initial release and testing phases, we're more open to talking with everyone interested about this. Until then, we'll probably keep a low profile.
