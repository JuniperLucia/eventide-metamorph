# Metamorph To-Do List
This is a list of things that need to happen that for whatever reason I can't reasonably do at the moment.

## Long-Term Implimentations
These are items that require a lot of work and that may be essential to the core of the datapack.

* Find a balance between 'Lineage' and 'Orchard' Origins, then implement it.
- 'Lineage' Origins are based on progressional trees that increase in strength as you progress down the tree.
- 'Orchard' Origins are based on presenting goals and rewarding completion of said goal with an Origin. Progressional trees are optional but still supported.
- A third option may be discovered. Ideas include poly-origins, perk lotteries, and origin-specific upgrade paths that do not change the origin, but merely improve it.
- Just had an idea as I was typing the last thing. What if you could change how the origin acts with certain items (like Deepwoken mantras and the augmentation table)?

* Create a public repository that has a shrunk-down version of the main datapack.
- Market it as a "Lite" version of the server that other people can play with and use.
- Keep the appeal to our server, as the origins will be more plentiful as well as have other custom features.
- Possibly add a "contributions" thing where people who want to add origins can add them through pull requests. By sending files through GitHub, it keeps us safe while also simplifying the process.

* Make a 10k/15k by 10k/15k custom map for Metamorph.
- This limits the spread players can have and can be used to eliminate unwanted vanilla features (e.g. nether highways)
- Also allows for custom ores to be created and added.
- Maybe experiment with territories while doing this.

* Create an establish a modpack, then find a way to safely and consistently make it available.
- I'm honestly not too sure how to satisfy the second condition.
- Mods (probably): Origins, ExtraOrigins, Origins Extra Keybinds, Gate of Babylon (Maybe? Might be better to make custom weapons instead.), and sodium-like mods.

## Origin Ideas

* 'Solar Spectre' [Advanced-Tier]
- Mirror-World 'Lunar Spirit'
- Lunar focuses on defense and passiveness; Solar focuses of offense and action.
- (Note: Fix 'Lunar Spirit' and give them mob neutrality)

* 'Aether Dweller' [Advanced-Tier]
- Height-Based; Requires the player to be high up and can see the sky.
- 'Cloud Walker' Ability; allows the player to fly when really high up. Needs to be nerfed speed-wise, somehow.
- Wind-Magic or something related.

* 'Grave Digger' [Standard-Tier]
- Slightly faster shovel-speed.
- Small chance when digging through something they'll get a gem or special item.
- Somehow change it so that it doesn't promote wiping out entire swaths of land.

* 'Nomad' [Standard-Tier]
- General exhaustion decrease.
- Foraged food gives more hunger.
- Some mob neutrality.
- AKA super chill wanderer. Being near a campfire gives buffs.

* 'Colonist' [Standard-Tier]
- Very basic farming/wood-cutting buffs.
- Generalized base-building buffs.
- Weak fighter.
- Honestly really weak and lame, likely a very early-game origin.

* 'Ram' [Standard-Tier]
- Reduced damage and tool effectiveness
- Fist damage scales with running speed
- Can shear themselves; has a cooldown
- Can digest grass

* 'Frog' [Standard-Tier]
- Can't walk, has to jump everywhere (I've done this before, I can do it again.)
- Ability to lick people and blind them as well as make them slippery
- Can increase reach with 'tongue'. Damage is reduced.
- Smol

* 'Songbird' [Standard-Tier]
- You've done this before, with moth on the third origins server.
- Stamina bar to balance flight.
- Can tweet.
- Smol

* 'Aristocrat' [Advanced-Tier]
- Eat valuables to gain buffs (yes, I'm dead serious.)
- Increased attack speed from official sword training. Lower defense from being weak.
- Get nausea when wearing leather armor (it's peasants clothing).
- Get weakness when your armor is at low durability (More concerned with armor quality and appearances than surviving).
